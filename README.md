How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Ensuring code is functional and secure begins from the design phase. Understanding the requirements, writing modular code, and testing are the key pieces focused on in this project. Using tools like JUnit to unit test during development and dependency checks to find security flaws are a good foundation to srart from regarding software security and testing. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpretting user needs requires a thorough understand of the system that is to be built. Sometimes the requirements are determined by the client, sometimes industry standards, and other times defined by the developers. They are incorporated into a program as a foundational piece in the design phase and tested throughout for accuracy. It's crucial to test edge cases, boundary points, null data, etc. to ensure the system is prepared for both correct and incorrect data. 

How do I approach designing software?

This class has changed how I design code a fair bit. The goal is still to solve the overarching problem, but I now have a greater focus on ensuring the code handles incorrect data. Not only do I consider how can I make code work, but also how I can keep a user or malicious attacker from breaking it. I have a greater understanding and appreciation for keeping as much data as possible private and testing units thoroughly and often for accuracy.
